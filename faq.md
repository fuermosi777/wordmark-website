## How to setup Email?

Use Gmail as an example:

```
SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
Email: example@gmail.co
Name: <Give it a name>
Password: <password>
```

> Even though Gmail is the fastest way to get started with sending emails, it is by no means a preferable solution unless you are using OAuth2 authentication. Gmail expects the user to be an actual user not a robot so it runs a lot of heuristics for every login attempt and blocks anything that looks suspicious to defend the user from account hijacking attempts. For example you might run into trouble if your server is in another geographical location â€“ everything works in your dev machine but messages are blocked in production.

## How to use relative image path in Preview?

Open "Configurations" and in "General" tab check "on" in "Enable relative path". Note that the relative path will only work when the markdown file has been saved somewhere in the operating system because otherwise WordMark does not know whom the image is relative to.

Also, even though you can see the images in Preview locally, however, it might not show correctly when you publish the post in most circumstances.

## Why all my opened files and folders are lost after reboot?

If you downloaded WordMark from the Mac App Store, you will encounter this problem. The reason is that Mac App Store's sandbox system disallow WordMark to open file or folder without user's permission. The issue is expected to be solved in the future updates. Until then, however, you can use non-MAS version WordMark. Download it from the homepage. If you already bought WordMark from the Mac App Store, feel free to send an Email to [Customer service](mailto:hi@wordmarkapp.com) to request a free license key.
